## Initialize project
First a *.env* file must be created based on this [example](.env.example). The the following commands have to be executed:<br> 

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-finance-django .

#Run container and start server
docker compose up -d

#Open bash in container
docker exec -it my-finance-django bash

#Apply database migrations, once in container's bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations 
python3 manage.py migrate 

python3 manage.py makemigrations app
python3 manage.py migrate app

#Create superuser, this will prompt inputs for username, email and password
python3 manage.py createsuperuser 
```

If configured correctly, after executing "*docker compose up -d*" the project should be accesible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
